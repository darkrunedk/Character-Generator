# Character Generator
This is (for the moment) a simple character generator. It currently uses 3 values (Gender, Race and Class) to generate a character.

The names are based on the race and gender. The dark elf and wood elf names that are used comes from of the Elder Scrolls series.

## Demo

I have a live demo at my website, which can be found at the following link:
